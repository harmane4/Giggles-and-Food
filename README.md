#  SUNSHINE FAMILY

##  Giggles and Food

 Giggles and Food is an application where parents, guardians, and caretakers of young family, (children under 12) can view restaurants with playground equipment in the Perth Area. It is aimed to make mealtime a lot more enjoyable.

 When a user wants to find a restaurant that has child friendly play equipment they a presented with a gallery. 

 If they want to view the location of the restaurant they are presented with a map which has markers for the locations and display the address. 

 Once they have visited a restaurant they can leave their own personal review so they can refer back to it.

While browsing through the restaurants, for your amusement, you will be able to amuse yourself with some of the “dad jokes”

When the gallery tab is clicked, it takes you the list of restaurants in Perth. When each picture in the gallery is clicked on, it directs you to that restaurant’s webpage, where you can look up for more information.
